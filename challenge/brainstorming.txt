Easy:
- print only the first two lines of a given file
- print everything except the first two lines of a given file.
- print only the last three lines of a given file
- print everything except the last three lines of a given file.
- print only lines in a file if they contain the word "date"
- print the contents of a file but with no new lines, replace new lines with single spaces.
- print the contents of a file but replace the word "date" with "time".
- print the contents of a file but with no blank lines.
- list only the directories in the current directory.
- write a command that succeeds if it is run in the afternoon/evening.

Medium:
- print all environment variables that contain USER, as a JSON document.
- in a directory, print the top ten files by their size, in descending order by size.  The output
  can have <file_size> <file> in each line.  Include headers and have the output formatted nice so the columns line up.

Difficult:
* recursively find all files that are over two weeks old
* Given some json, print out just a certain field.
* Create a git repo that your co-workers can install easily with one command that's found in its readme.
  After installation, they should be able to run all the bash commands from the git repo, without needing to source
  anything.  Hint: one method is to have the command download an installer script and then immediately run it.

Kubernetes:
- find all services that don't match any pods
- find all ingresses whose service does not exist
- list all pods that are not running
- given a pod name, find all services that match it.
- given a tls secret in K8s, produce tls.key and tls.crt files.
- print all pods along with their resource requests and limits.
- print all persistent volumes whose backing volume does not exist.
- delete all replica sets with desired size of zero.
- find all pods with a mounted volume that is over 80% full.

AWS:
- print all ELBs that don't have any route53 record set pointing to them.
- print all cloudwatch alarms that have not received data for over a week.
- find all route53 records that point to an ELB that does not exist.
- find all cloudwatch alarms that have a given action
- list all ec2 instances with a given tag.
