General Advise:
* Not knowing about CLI commands and/or their options.
* Not switching to a higher language for complicated things.
* lack of comments and/or documentation.
* The only thing worse than "code without documentation" is "documentation without code".  All too often I see
confluent pages that have command line
16. Strongly prefer to automate and script everything.
