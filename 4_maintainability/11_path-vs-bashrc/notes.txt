19. Prefer functions over aliases.
    - aliases can't be used in scripts and functions.
    - not available to other people on your system.
    - requires repeatedly sourcing .bashrc or .bash_profile.

18. Use .bashrc or .bash_profile for functions that must alter your global environment variables.
    - otherwise put a command on the common path, /usr/local/bin

17. Prefer placing commands onto the common path instead of placing them into .bashrc or .bash_profile.

* anti-pattern: sourcing other scripts instead of putting them on the path.
  - if the script moves, your code silently breaks.
  - can mess with global env variables.

* anti-pattern: Not putting scripts on your path.
  - constantly needing to source.
  - confused about why things are not working, why your updates are not happening.
  - much easier for one script to call on others.
