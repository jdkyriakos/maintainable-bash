1.  Encapsulate code in functions.  This helps isolate it so you have more reliable results.
    - use #!/usr/bin/env bash
    - check bash version (supports arrays?)

* Anti-pattern: Not using functions.
* Anti-pattern: redundant code, instead of making functions.
* Anti-pattern: copying/pasting instead of re-using code.
* Anti-pattern: Not designing code to let people manually run individual pieces.
