Variable Scope

export makes variables visible to the current shell/program and all sub-processes/shells.
local means a variable will not be visible once the current function ends.
With neither export nor local, any variable that is set is visible throughout
the current process, even if the current function ends, but is not visible to sub or parent
processes.
